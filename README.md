## Beer Stocks | [Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one/)

Project carried out to unit test, a REST API for the management of beer stocks, and also to present the main concepts and advantages of creating unit tests with JUnit and Mockito through the practice of TDD.

Topics covered:

* Download a project through Git to develop our unit tests.
* Conceptual presentation about tests: the pyramid of the types of tests, and also the importance of each type of test during the development cycle.
* Focus on unit tests: show why it is important to develop these types of tests as part of the software development cycle.
* Main frameworks for unit testing in Java: JUnit, Mockito and Hamcrest.
* Development of unit tests to validate basic functionalities: creation, listing, consultation by name and exclusion of beers.
* TDD: presentation and practical example in 2 important features: increase and decrease in the number of beers in the stock.
